Nuit et Jour is our stack made for the [Nuit de l'info](https://www.nuitdelinfo.com/) 

## Stack

- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo with Turbo for build orchestration
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime and package manager
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI
  - [Turbo](https://turbo.build) for monorepo build orchestration and caching
